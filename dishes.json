Pre-cut cucumber and avocado into batons and store them in tight containers (add a light brush of rice vinegar or lemon to avocado to reduce browning).

Use frozen berries instead of fresh—they're often cheaper and blend into a creamier texture. Make 2-3 servings at once; the chia seeds will thicken it overnight, improving the pudding consistency.",
