# Hello there, I’m Vadim
I’m honestly terrible at the whole food thing: I want to eat healthily—no money. Want something delicious—that takes all night. Want fast—it turns unhealthy. It feels like you can’t have it all at once.

But here's an idea: What if we took every dish in the world and rated it on a 10-point scale for:

* <span data-icon="taste"></span> **Taste**
* <span data-icon="health"></span> **Health**
* <span data-icon="speed"></span> **Speed**
* <span data-icon="cost"></span> **Cost**

Then summed them up and averaged? Which dishes would make it to the top?

At first, I thought the healthiest dishes in restaurants and cafes would be closest to perfection. After all, they optimize the other three factors: time, cost, and taste. That was my initial theory—7 years ago.

All that was left was selecting healthy dishes and calculating their ranking. That’s when I discovered a whole world of omelettes, unusual soups, and salads. Without extra time or money, I somehow started eating better.

But my ratings were subjective—and that's how I automated the entire system.

How do you even automate something like this?
Well, I gathered the nerve to analyze massive datasets: sentiment from social media, summaries of scientific papers, recipe parsing, economic databases.

That’s how Foood.top was born — a personal dish ranking with automatic re-ranking based on your priorities.
